== Supervisor Domain Identifier and Protection Register (`mttp`) 

The `mttp` register is an `XLEN`-bit read/write register, formatted as shown in Figure 3.1 for `XLEN=32` and Figure 3.2 for `XLEN=64`, which controls physical address protection for supervisor domains. This register holds the physical page number (`MTTPPN`) of the root page of the memory tracking table (`MTT`), a supervisor domain identifier (`SDID`), which facilitates address protection fences on a per-supervisor-domain basis; and the `MODE` field, which selects the address protection scheme (MTT Mode to be enforced) for physical addresses. The MTT is a structure that holds the access permissions for a physical address and is looked up per the programmed `MODE`. 

Attempts to read or write `mttp` while executing in U, S or HS-mode will raise an illegal instruction exception.

Table 3.1 shows the encodings of the `MODE` field when `XLEN=32` and `XLEN=64`. When `mttp` `MODE=Bare`, supervisor physical addresses have no MTT-based protection across supervisor domains beyond the physical memory protection scheme described in Section 3.7 of the RISC-V privileged architecture specification [1]. In this case, the remaining fields (`SDID`, `MTTPPN`) in `mttp` must be set to zeros, else generate a fault. When `XLEN=32`, the other valid settings for `MODE` are `Smmtt34` and `Smmtt34rw`, to support allow/disallow and read-write access permissions for 34-bit system physical addresses. 

When `XLEN=64`, other than `BARE`, the other valid settings for `MODE` are `Smmtt[46, 56][rw]` to support read-write/access permissions for 56-bit system physical addresses. 

The remaining `MODE` settings when `XLEN=64` are `reserved` for future use and may define different interpretations of the other fields in `mttp`.

Implementations are not required to support all defined `MODE` settings when `XLEN=64`. A write to `mttp` with an unsupported `MODE` value is not ignored. Instead, the fields of `mttp` are `WARL` in the normal way, when so indicated. 

The `MTTPPN` refers to an `MTTL3` table or an `MTTL2` table based on physical address width (`PAW`). For 56<=`PAW`<46, `MTTL3` table must be of size `2^(PAW-43)` bytes and naturally aligned to that sized byte boundary. For 46<=`PAW`<32 the `MTTL2` table must be of size 2^(`PAW`-23) or 2^(`PAW`-22) bytes (depending on the Smmtt `MODE` selected) and must be naturally aligned to that sized byte boundary. In these modes, the lowest two bits of the physical page number (`MTTPPN`) in `mttp` always read as zeros. 

The number of `SDID` bits is `UNSPECIFIED` and may be zero. The number of implemented `SDID` bits, termed `SDIDLEN`, may be determined by writing one to every bit position in the `SDID` field, then reading back the value in `mttp` to see which bit positions in the `SDID` field hold a one. The least-significant bits of `SDID` are implemented first: that is, if `SDIDLEN` > 0, `SDID`[`SDIDLEN`-1:0] is writable. The maximal value of `SDIDLEN`, termed `SDIDMAX`, is 8 for `Smmtt34[rw]` or 16 for `Smmtt46[rw]`, `Smmtt56[rw]`. 

The `mttp` register is considered active for the purposes of the physical address protection algorithm unless the effective privilege mode is `M`. 

Physical accesses that began while `mttp` was active are not required to complete or terminate when `mttp` is no longer active, unless an `FENCE.MTT` instruction matches the `SDID` (and optionally, `PA`) is executed. The `FENCE.MTT` instruction must be used to ensure that updates to the `MTT` data structures are observed by subsequent implicit reads to those structures by a hart.

Note that writing `mttp` does not imply any ordering constraints between `S-mode` and `G-stage` page-table updates and subsequent address translations. If a supervisor domain's `MTT` structure has been modified, or if a `SDID` is reused, it may be necessary to execute a `FENCE.MTT` instruction before or after writing `mttp`.
